Because we are using an Interface makes sense
to force the usage of a method that selects the min or max iteration.
this way the implementation is more clear (and less 'hacked').
(there is also a 2nd reason for this, if a multithread version
was implemented, some 'hacked' solutions would not work)

Using the Interface we can change the generic minimax behaviour (will still be generic!)
to iterate in the following way:

MINIMAX DEPTH % 4
0 AI places  (max)
1 AI rotates (max iteration, does not swap in prev)
2 player places (min)
3 player rotates (min iteration, does not swap in prev)

there are no skip iterations using this Interface min/ma selector
