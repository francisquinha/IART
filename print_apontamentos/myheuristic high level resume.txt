check which rows, lines and diagonals can still be used to make 5 straights(not blocked) 
for both black and white
not in a static sense (that would be trivial !!! !!! !!!)
but considering that the board squares can be rotated

THE BAD

does not check imminent victories or defeats 
(
the Minimax can avoid these to a certain extent
if there is a known pattern that = victory, it can be 
used together with other heristics
)

does not consider "play canceling" 
(when many possibilities are blocked in current rotation and the
opponent always cancels the rotation with it's inverse we endup
considering possibilities that will never occur)
only focus on placement and not on rotations

maybe heavy to compute often

THE GOOD

long term planning 
(just like tempi for example. 
does not goes towards a victory but tries to keep the odds in favor)

compatible - can be given a certain "weight"(importance) and used with other heuristics "easily"
(functioning as the long term sight)

considers the entire board 

--------------------------
heuristics may be combined
